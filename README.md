## Version 1.0.0-Alpha.1

- [Changelog](http://www.hockeyapp.net/help/sdk/tvos/1.0.0-alpha.1/docs/docs/Changelog.html)

## Introduction

HockeySDK-tvOS brings HockeyApp's powerful crash reporting to tvOS.

If your app crashes, a crash log with the same format used by the Apple Crash Reporter is written to the device's storage. If the user starts the app again, they are asked to submit the crash report to HockeyApp. This works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store!

We know that developers have come to love the other powerful features that HockeyApp provides, such as:

* Update Ad-Hoc / Enterprise apps
* Update notification for the App Store
* Feedback
* Authentication

Unfortunately, tvOS has a lot of API limitations which prevent us from providing these features. As always, to ensure you can submit your apps for tvOS to the App Store, we avoid using private API.

<a id="requirements"></a> 
## 1. Requirements

1. We assume that you already have a project in Xcode, and that this project is opened in Xcode 7 or later.
2. The SDK supports tvOS 9.0 and later.

**[NOTE]** 
Be aware that tvOS requires Bitcode.

<a id="setup"></a>
## 2. Setup

As HockeySDK-tvOS is currently an alpha-release, the SDK must be integrated using our binary distribution. Other integration methods for the SDK (such as Cocoapods or using our Mac App) will be added later.

### 2.1 Obtain an App Identifier

Please see the "[How to create a new app](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/about-general-faq/how-to-create-a-new-app)" tutorial. This will provide you with an HockeyApp-specific App Identifier to be used to initialize the SDK.

### 2.2 Download the SDK

1. Download the latest [HockeySDK-tvOS](http://www.hockeyapp.net/releases/) framework, provided as a Zip file.
2. Unzip the file. You will see a folder named `HockeySDK-tvOS`. (Be sure not to use 3rd-party unzip tools!)

### 2.3 Copy the SDK into your project directory in Finder

Move the unzipped `HockeySDK-tvOS` folder into your project directory. In our experience, most projects will have a directory specifically set aside for 3rd-party libraries. These instructions assume that your project has such a directory, and that it is called `Vendor`.

<a id="setupxcode"></a>
### 2.4 Set up the SDK in Xcode

1. We recommend creating a group in your Xcode project for 3rd-party libraries, similar to the structure of the files on disk. In this case, the group will be called `Vendor`, matching the directory.
2. Make sure the `Project Navigator` is visible (âŒ˜+1)
3. Drag & drop `HockeySDK.framework` from your window in `Finder` (this would be the `Vendor` directory) into your project in Xcode, and move it to the desired location in the `Project Navigator` (e.g., into the group called `Vendor`)
5. A sheet will appear. Select `Create groups for any added folders`, and check the checkbox for your target. Be sure to select your tvOS target if you have more than one. Now click `Finish`.

<a id="modifycode"></a>
### 2.5 Integrate the SDK into your code 

**Objective-C**

1. Open the file containing your app delegate (`AppDelegate.m` in a default project).
2. Add the following line below your own `import` statements:

    ```objectivec
    @import HockeySDK;
    ```

3. In the method `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`, add the following lines to initialize and start the HockeySDK:

    ```objectivec
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];
    // Do additional configuration if needed here
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
    ```

**Swift**

1. Open the file containing your app delegate (`AppDelegate.swift` in a default project).
2. Add the following line below your own `import` statements:
    
    ```swift
    import HockeySDK
    ```

3. In the method `application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:[NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool`, add the following lines to initialize and start the HockeySDK:
    
    ```swift
    BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().configureWithIdentifier("APP_IDENTIFIER");
    // Do additional configuration if needed here
    BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().startManager();
    ```

*Note:* The SDK has been optimized to defer as much initialization as it can until needed,  while still making sure that crashes on startup can be caught. Each module executes other code with a delay of up to several seconds. This ensures that your startup method will execute as fast as possible and that the SDK will not block the launch process (which would be a poor user experience and potentially result in your app being killed by the system watchdog process).

### 2.6 Bitcode

Make sure to read the [article in our knowledgebase about Bitcode](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-ios-mac-os-x/how-to-solve-symbolication-problems#bitcode) to make sure your crashes are symbolicated correctly.

### 2.7 Congratulations
**Congratulations, you're all set to use HockeySDK!**

## 3. Crash Reporting Features

As the current release we provide is an alpha version, crash reporting currently has limited confiuration and fine-tuning options.

<a id="disablecrashes"></a>
### 3.1 Disable Crash Reporting
The HockeySDK enables crash reporting **by default**. Crashes will be immediately sent to the server the next time the app is launched.

To provide you with the best crash reporting, we use Plausible Labs' [PLCrashReporter]("https://github.com/plausiblelabs/plcrashreporter") at [Version 1.2 / Commit 356901d7f3ca3d46fbc8640f469304e2b755e461]("https://github.com/plausiblelabs/plcrashreporter/commit/356901d7f3ca3d46fbc8640f469304e2b755e461").

This feature can be disabled with the following code:

**Objective-C**

```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDisableCrashManager:YES]; //disable crash reporting
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```

**Swift**

```swift
BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().configureWithIdentifier("APP_IDENTIFIER");
BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().disableCrashManager = true;
BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().startManager();
```

<a id="aboutcrashes"></a>
### 3.2 How are crash reports sent to HockeyApp?

Crashes are sent the next time the app starts, without any user interaction.

The SDK deliverably avoids sending the reports at the time of the crash, as it is not possible to implement such a mechanism safely. In particular, there is no way to do network access in an async-safe fashion without causing a severe drain on the device's resources, and any error whatsoever creates the danger of a double-fault or deadlock, resulting in losing the crash report entirely. We have found that users do relaunch the app, because most don't know what happened, and you will receive the vast majority of crash reports.

Sending pending crash reports on startup is done asynchronously, using `NSURLSession`. This avoids any issues with slow startup and is resilient against poor network connectivity.

<a id="debuginfo"></a>
### 3.3 Debug Information

To check if data was sent properly to HockeyApp and also see some additional SDK debug loggging data in the console, add the following line before `startManager`:

**Objective-C**

```objectivec
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] configureWithIdentifier:@"APP_IDENTIFIER"];
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDebugLogEnabled:YES];
[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
```

**Swift**

```swift
BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().configureWithIdentifier("APP_IDENTIFIER");
BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().debugLogEnabled = true;
BITHockeyManager.sharedHockeyManager().startManager();
```

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## 5.Troubleshooting

1. iTunes Connect rejection

    Make sure none of the following files are copied into your app bundle. This can be checked by examining the `Copy Bundle Resources` item in the `Build Phases` tab of your app target in the Xcode project, or by looking within the final `.app` bundle after making your build:

        - `HockeySDK.framework` (unless you've built your own version of the SDK as a dynamic framework - if you don't know what this means, you don't have to worry about it)
        - `de.bitstadium.HockeySDK-iOS-4.0-Alpha.1.docset`

2. Features not working as expected

    Enable debug output to the console to see additional information from the SDK as it initializes modules, sends and receives network requests, and more, by adding the following code before calling `startManager`:

        [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] setDebugLogEnabled: YES];
